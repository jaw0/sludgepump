During what I will claim to have been a fit of demonic possession
last weekend, my fingers spewed forth new newsfeeding code.

briefly: 

	it is currently CNFS specific, but easily adapted
	(but it requires arts to be stored in wire format)

	slightly better at shoving articles out than innfeed
	at roughly equal CPU load, and much lower memory use
	(or at least my stats suggest such)

	runs as a channel feed, one process per site, with
	multiple connections to that site.

	it is not documented, nor is the code well commented
	or even well written
	
	I am currently running it on SunOS and NetBSD, feeding
	inn, cyclone, and diablo sites.

	the code is not portable, and will likely not compile
	on your system

	if you use it, I do not guarantee that the earth will
	not open up and swallow your news server into the
	fiery bowels of Hell. use at your own risk

	if you pester me with questions about it, I will
	ignore you.

	if you send me patches for bug fixes, I may apply
	them, or I may ignore you.


code is located at:
	ftp.op.net:/pub/src/INN-stuff/sludgepumper-1.0.tar.gz
